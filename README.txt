Budgeteer
by: Balazs Szemes

This should become in the fullness of time a personal expense tracking webapp. It is a learning project, so many things may not be ideally executed.
The main planned functionality is to be able store expense items, budgets, income items, and provide a comparison of these. 
The basic architecture is a nodejs-sequelize backend, with postgres, frontend will be html+css+js.

WORK IN PROGRESS, not operable in current version, there is just some unintegrated barebone functionality for now.
