Budgeteer
by: Balazs Szemes

This should become in the fullness of time a personal expense tracking webapp. It is a learning project, so many things may not be ideally executed.
The main planned functionality is to be able store expense items, budgets, income items, and provide a comparison of these. 
The basic architecture is a nodejs-sequelize backend, with postgres, frontend is html+css+js.

WORK IN PROGRESS, minimal functionality now working, but just for showcasing.

Current plans:

---BASIC SCOPE----------------------
--done - add income item 
--done - add expense item
- add budget item
- show items from a custom time period (monthly by dopdown?)
--done - list expenses for a time period 
--done - list incomes for a time period 
- list budgets for a time period 
--done - show monthly balance
--done - count balance
--done - add category
--done (barely )- add passable html
--done - add css
--done - add category - expense - budget linking
--done - integrate backend with frontend

---PHASE2
- modify existing values
- add multiple expenses in one step
- validations
- return functions in case of success (data store)

---PHASE3
- statistics
 - income in a year
 - expense in a year
- tests for backend
